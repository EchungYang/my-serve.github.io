## What is MY-SERVE

MY-SERVE is a study about understanding young people's experiences in accessing community mental health services. MY-SERVCE stands for Mental health in Youth: SERVice Experience. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, research has shown that children and young people’s mental health has got worse and there has been a large increase in the number of children and young people being referred to mental health services (eg. GP counsellor, school counsellor, CAMHS). This study aims to understand young people’s experiences of mental health services through in-depth interviews. In particular, we’d like to understand why some groups of young people may not improve as much as others after accessing services. We’d like to speak to young people and their caregivers to find out what worked or didn’t work for them, so we can suggest ways to improve services.


## Who are we looking for?

We would like to invite you if you have been seen by mental health services and are between the ages of 16 and 24, or, you are the caregiver of a young person who has been seen by mental health services and are between the ages of 16 and 24.

## What will happen to me if I take part?

We will arrange a day and time that’s suitable for you, and the interview can be either online or face-to-face at the university. The interview may be with your young person if that is what you both wish. If you are happy to go ahead with the interview, you will need to sign a consent form. 

We will record our conversation so that we can remember everything we talked about. The recording will only be accessible by the research team and it will be destroyed at the end of the study. The interview will take about up to an hour. We will listen to everything you have to say, and be sensitive to how you are feeling. Our team have a lot of experience of doing interviews with young people and caregivers and we will do our best to reassure you and make you feel at ease. 


This research project has three components: 

1. A brief questionnaire, 
2. A computerised experiment, 
3. and a self-report survey.

### Part 1 Questionnaire
The first thing you will come across is a super short questionnaire. It consists of an information sheet about the project for you to read through, a consent form for you to sign/click, and an ID generator that gives you a unique ID, which you may need to write it down for later use. 

__Estimate duration: 1min__

### Part 2 Computerised experiment
If you click the link at the end of the questionnaire, you will be directed to an online research platform that only works for PC or laptops. So please make sure you open the experiment link on an appropriate device. You will complete three tasks on this platform, and the task rules and instructions will be displayed before you start. 

__Estimated duration: 25-30min__

### Part 3 Self-report survey
Once you have done the experiment, you will be re-directed to the survey platform to complete a short demographic questionnaire as well as a task-related questionnaire. __You will need the ID number generated in Part 1 to answer one of the survey items.__ This is because the survey data and the experiment data are stored separately, which requires an ID to pair two datasets done by the same participant for later analysis. However, it does not mean that your data can be tracked by any means as all data are saved anonymously.  

__Estimated duration: 3-5min__



# You will have a chance to win a prize draw of up to £50 for participation.

## Q&A 

### __1. Are the any risks?__

There are likely no known risks associated with participating in this study. 

### __2. How will my data be used?__

The data collected for this study are likely to be analysed and reported at professional conferences and/or in academic books or articles. These reports will be written based on group data. For the individual data, no identifying information will allow others to trace responses back to the person who gave them.

### __3. Will my responses be kept anonymous and confidential?__

All information gathered will be kept strictly confidential and only used for research purposes. We store the data using random ID numbers so that the data cannot be linked back to you or your family. The data will be stored on secured electronic files or in a locked cabinet in the Faculty of Education, and it will be accessible only by the PI and the lead researcher for this study (Yiqiong Yang).

### __4. Will there be any form of incentives?__
You will have a chance to win a prize draw of up to £50 for participation. However, you will be informed after the data collection process has done, which can take months. 


This study was reviewed by the University of Cambridge Department of Psychology ethics panel. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns you would like to discuss.
